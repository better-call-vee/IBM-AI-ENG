Regression model is about **Numbers** but not choosing a label(YES/NO, A decision etc)

suppose, in a hospital, I need to calculate the probability (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) that a patient will be readmitted within 30 days based on their medical history. 
this is not a regression problem. 
It depends on the decision of YES/NO. that's the feature of **Classification** !

Estimating the specific amount of rainfall (in millimeters) for tomorrow based on today's temperature, humidity, and wind speed. That's an example of regression problem. 


A perfect example of a **non-linear** relationship == working more hours isn't going to increase an employee's performance scores. It often looks like an **inverted U-shape**. Performance increases with hours worked up to a certain optimal point, after which it plateaus and then sharply declines due to burnout, fatigue, and reduced efficiency. This is precisely why **nonlinear regression** existsâ€”to capture these more complex, true-to-life patterns that a straight line (linear regression) would completely miss.

## Multiple regression Model 
is needed to get smarter outputs. (desi dim - farm er dim)
